## Bananas International Airport

Welcome to Bananas International Airport, where it's sunny 80% of the time.

Our airport can only take 10 planes and you're welcome to land here as long as we have space and you're crazy enough. Just make sure that you build your plane up in the air - this is Bananas after all!

#### What can I do in here?

So far you can only:

* Land your plane, as long as there's space (even when it's stormy!)

* Take-off, as long as there's no storm coming.

#### What do you mean "land even when it's stormy??"

Bananas is a land of one banana brain only and its airport is far from perfect. So there's a couple of things we can't do just yet:

* We can't prevent you from landing when the weather is stormy

* We can't send a message to you saying that you can or can't land
