Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client.

```
As a pilot
So that I can arrive at my specified destination
I would like to land my plane at the appropriate airport

As a pilot
So that I can set off for my specified destination
I would like to be able to take off from the appropriate airport

As an air traffic controller
So that I can avoid collisions
I want to be able to prevent airplanes landing when the airport if full

As an air traffic controller
So that I can avoid accidents
I want to be able to prevent airplanes landing or taking off when the weather is stormy

## Bananas International Airport

Welcome to Bananas International Airport, where it's sunny 80% of the time.

Our airport can only take 10 planes and you're welcome to land here if there's space and you're crazy enough. Just make sure that you build your plane up in the air - this is Bananas after all!

#### What can I do in here?

Bananas is a land of one banana brain only and its airport is far from perfect. This is what you can do at the moment:

* Land your plane, as long as there's space and the weather allows it.

* Take-off, as long as there's no storm coming.

#### What can I expect from Bananas International Airport in the future?

* A message telling you that you can or can't land
